Right now the `Floor`  reads the `input.txt` file then passes the information as a `DataPacket` to the `Scheduler` who sends it to the `Elevator` who sends it back to the `Scheduler` who then sends it back to the `Floor`<br>
Floor --> Scheduler --> Elevator --> Scheduler --> Floor

### TODO 
Edit the code to work in a loop to read multiple lines<br>
Add test case<br>
Add UML<br>
